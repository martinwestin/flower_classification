# Flower Classification
A neural network with Tensorflow in python that can classify images of flowers in to one of five categories.
#
This is a program that can classify images of different flowers into one of the following catrgories:
#### Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, Tulip
The model is based on the MobileNetV2 model from Tensorflow (but with extra layers added), and can classify images with ~70% accuracy.
## Files
The file "image_processing.py" is used to augment, resize and in other ways process images. "model.py" is used to train model
and to load and split data. You can also run this script to look at some predictions the model makes on the test data.
#
The file "model.h5" contains a pretrained model. Do not edit this file. If you run the "model.py" script and retrain the model,
the program will save this retrained model to model.h5.
#
I have also added a GUI (with tkinter) ni order to make it easy to test new images. Run "GUI.py" to test the GUI funciton.
